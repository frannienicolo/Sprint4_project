# Sprint4_project
For this project, I employed the use of pandas, streamlit, and plotly-express to create various scatterplots and histograms that provide relevant and useful information regarding the dataset "vehicles_us.csv". This web app works as a tool to see how different factors impact the prices of the vehicles in the dataset. With the use of streamlit, I have created dropboxes above each graph so that users can decide which variable they want to look at in comparison to vehicle prices. I have also created a feature to sort the dataset by vehicle condition.

In order to launch this project on your local machine, you can go to my repository, clone it using CLI, and then enter "streamline run app.py". You can also click on this Render link:
